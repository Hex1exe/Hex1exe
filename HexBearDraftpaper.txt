- Where Hex Bear came from -
Bears have always been shunned and censored for their bearish speech for wanting the best price for the best appreciating asset in the world. Hex Bears in particular were silenced in the great plummit of 2021. Our bearish 1st Amendment rights could not be exercised as stated in the founder's tweet of 2020.
Solution - HexBear.io
Ben Kraun (legendary Hex holder) struck out on his own to discover a new place, free from persecution and censorship. In this new place, he created a token with a supply representing the most sacred and loyal number 5555. He then created products and places to gather for everyone. Everything was cheap and abundant.

Gathering the best parts of DeFi develpment under one roof to support constant growth is the main focus of Hex Bear. Making education a necessary part of the Hex Bear community by incentivizing good work will expand it's user base faster than any community ever formed.

Tokenomics
The intitial available supply was provided to the exchange of Uniswap V1 being that it was the cheapest pair to create at the time.
